Inside the Main class, there is a method called isPalindrome that takes a single argument, word, which is the word we want to check for being a palindrome.
Convert to Lowercase: First, the method converts the input word to lowercase to make the palindrome check case-insensitive. This means that "Madam" and "madam" will be treated as the same.
Initialize Pointers: Two pointers are initialized: left is set to the beginning of the word (index 0) and right is set to the end of the word (index word.length() - 1).

The method then enters a while loop that continues as long as the left pointer is less than the right pointer.
Character Comparison: Inside the loop, the characters at the left and right positions are compared. If they are not equal, it means the word is not a palindrome.
If a mismatch is found, it prints that the word is not a palindrome and exits the method using return.
Move Pointers: If the characters match, the left pointer is incremented by 1 and the right pointer is decremented by 1, moving both pointers towards the center of the word.

If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it means all characters matched symmetrically. In this case, the method prints that the word is a palindrome.

The main method is the entry point of the program. Here, an instance of the Main class is created and the isPalindrome method is called with the word "madam".
Output: The method will output whether "madam" is a palindrome or not.
